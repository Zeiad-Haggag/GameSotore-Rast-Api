# GameStore REST API with ASP.NET Core

This project is a backend REST API built with ASP.NET Core, designed to provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing games and game information. The project is based on the YouTube tutorial series "ASP.NET Core Full Course For Beginners" by Julio Casal.

## Introduction

Gamestore REST API offers a robust backend solution for managing a collection of games and their related details. This project serves as an excellent learning resource for beginners aiming to master ASP.NET Core and REST API development.

## Features

- **Game Management**: CRUD operations for game entities.
- **Game Information Management**: CRUD operations for details related to each game.

## Skills and Work Done

In this project, I have applied and developed several skills in ASP.NET Core and backend development:

- **API Development**: Designed and implemented RESTful API endpoints for game and game information management.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Utilized EF Core for database operations, including creating models, migrations, and handling data persistence.
- **Dependency Injection**: Utilized ASP.NET Core’s built-in dependency injection for managing service lifetimes and resolving dependencies.
- **Database Design**: Created a relational database schema for storing games and game-related information. In this project, we use SQLite for quick testing the API endpoints.


## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL.
